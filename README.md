# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, implemented in both Go and Python.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual series of programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. Created by Eric Wastl, these challenges:
- Are released daily during December (like an advent calendar)
- Cover various difficulty levels
- Test problem-solving and programming skills
- Can be solved in any programming language
